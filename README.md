# RFLink-Clone-Nano-ESP8266

RFlink clone (X10RF only) running on an Arduino Nano or ESP8266

What is RFLink  
Excellent RF controller for a wealth of RF 433Mhz, 868Mhz, 2.4Ghz running on a standard Arduino Mega.

Why a clone  
I created a clone for the following reasons:  
- I love Reverse Engineering of 433Mhz RF gadgets  
- The RFLink software works great (try it!) but:  
  = Requires an Arduino Mega to support the wealth of RF equipment  
  = Arduino source code is currently unavailable, with the exception of an older "development" version. Code is supplied as "hex". So changes can be made to the latest code.  
  = My favorite platform are Arduino Nano and ESP8266.  
- Did I mention that I love Reverse Engineering RF gadgets  

Disclaimer  
This is a prototype under development. Works for me, but you may have to change the code for your environment or use case.
